# Tensorflow_DNN

Here I use tensorflow to write functions, you can set any number of hiddens layers and nodes. Also, you can set your learning rate. So it is easier for you to try different network structures.

I only run my main functions. I change Mnist data for train and test. You can change your own data for classification and have a try.

You can modify more details in .py files.

In add_layers.py, you can change activation function. Here I use relu.

In session_run.py, you can change optimizer methods. Here I use AdamOptermizer.
